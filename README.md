# Math 280 - Code Repository (UC Merced)

Welcome to the **Math 280** code repository at UC Merced! This repository is intended to host **code and relevant data** for the course.  

> **Note:** Lecture notes and other course materials are available on **Canvas**. This GitHub repository is focused on **examples, exercises, and data for computational work**.

## Repository Structure

- **`Data/`** – Relevant datasets for course examples and exercises.  
- **`Examples/`** – Code examples and exercises illustrating key concepts.  

Currently, the `Examples/` directory contains:

- **Least-Squares** – Starting with the prostate data example from ESL.

Additional examples and exercises will be added throughout the semester.

## Questions or Feedback

For questions about the code or datasets, please **do not submit issues on GitHub**.  
Instead, contact:
